# ecosia-town
All files for creating the Ecosia Office in Gather.Town

To edit tilesets and maps, use [Tiled](https://snapcraft.io/tiled).

Directories:

 - maps: contains TMX files, which are the whole maps
 - tilesets: contains TSX, which contain a texture and some other settings
 - textures: contains PNGs, which are used by the tilesets

Map files should contain layers. Some layers are part of the background, and others are part of the foreground. They should be uploaded separately to gather town.
